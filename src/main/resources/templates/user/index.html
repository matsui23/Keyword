<p class="table_data">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKeyword is an app that allows you to generate, store, and customize random passwords. </br>
    Serving as a secure location for the storage of passwords and a utilizing a system to create unique pseudo random ones. </br>
    This promotes more secure account creation habits for all those who create/update passwords often.</br>
    After registering and logging in you can visit the "Mods" page to create mods.

    </br>
    </br>

    Mods serve as fragments that are hashed together to generate personalized passwords.  Mods can be saved as one of three </br>
    different types: Alphabetic, Numeric, or Special.  Each corresponding to a type of character a password might </br>
    contain.

    </br>
    </br>

    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Creating a large library of mods allows the Generator to produce more diverse keys. </br>
    Edit your mod list however you see fit.  Keep it shorter to generate keys that have less variance but still contain </br>
    segments the user specifies.  Or, create a large library to see drastically different results each time.
